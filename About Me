Hello
My name is Devin and I am from St. Paul Minnesota. I am fairly new to GitHub but expect I will love the version control it offers.
I spend my free time working on various projects that incorporate Python, Bash, Java, HTML, CSS, and PHP. I am looking forward to building
innovative software with like minded problem solvers.
